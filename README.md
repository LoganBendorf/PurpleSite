The site's hosted on my laptop, so it might not be up all the time. <br />
Website URL: https://www.purplesite.skin
<br /> <br />
If you want to run it yourself: <br />
&emsp* Install the openssl library, openssl requires perl be installed first <br />
&emsp* Run "make" in the PurpleSite directory <br />
&emsp* Then enter "sudo ./https_server port". By default the server runs on port 443
